## Project Introduction

I was watching a Youtube short explaining thermistors (yes, that's pretty on-brand for my algorithm) and immediately thought of my dad. Hear me out... when they travel, my dad doesn't trust their ancient furnace, so he puts a wifi temperature sensor that [we bought on Amazon](https://www.amazon.com/sspa/click?ie=UTF8&spc=MTo0ODkzNDEzMDEyOTgxMDc2OjE3MTA2OTcwNzg6c3BfYXRmOjMwMDAyNzMwMDE5MjEwMjo6MDo6&url=%2FGovee-Indoor-Temperature-Humidity-Sensor%2Fdp%2FB0872ZWV8X%2Fref%3Dsr_1_4_sspa%3Fcrid%3D3O8OT92MF9WNX%26dib%3DeyJ2IjoiMSJ9.M-kltDBG67cR7ecW92gCHCCdGqoQEjLq2ejWaFYuoYtdA-EH59ZKw8bJoBHcws2OFj0cgWRJflZHVAxyqrMul_ITpPardnizbxPtakQTc-ilViy9wdxdnoQ0InkqY2bfRp8WZSvp2_XTOAB3J39gc__BIeFqKW16_b-s1W1pEQjRjU8As_AJ2SFRWdnSGAOCgP41K73FOoQhzrsQ9NLSJP0lXjORiB291J1SUZf2fB15TDthGKlOAAJjzMPCXWPkgSM74FMTjI_eiG3dObHEFyct6sRToznnrpP2zquQy54.odpNqkuvoo3nnJK-dO3xyxRmMB97lr-FlruDfUAymgI%26dib_tag%3Dse%26keywords%3Dwifi%2Bthermometer%26qid%3D1710697078%26sprefix%3Dwifi%2Bthermo%252Caps%252C193%26sr%3D8-4-spons%26sp_csd%3Dd2lkZ2V0TmFtZT1zcF9hdGY%26psc%3D1) in one of the rooms.

It ended up costing something like $40, though, and since I'm looking for a small project for learning overall E2E electronic component manufacturing (essentially what goes into _productionizing_ a design), I think this will be a good, quick project that will teach me the following things:

1. PCB design
2. Thermistors
3. More experience reading datasheets
4. Introduction to ESP32 Microcontrollers
5. Battery implementation (charge controllers, battery choice, etc)

To start off, I need to try and identify the thermistors I currently have laying around and try to get an accurate temperature using just an Arduino.

Oh, and I forgot to mention, if this project costs more than $10 USD to build, I will consider this a failure.
