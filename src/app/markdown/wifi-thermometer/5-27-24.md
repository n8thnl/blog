The last post was unfittingly titled *Hardware Finalizations* which might not have been the whole truth. I guess this is why you don't create your PCB before starting writing your firmware right...

### Problems with Thermistors

Originally, the plan was to have a thermistor feeding an ADC port on the ESP32 which would convert the analog voltage from the thermistor into a resistance that could be again converted into a temperature by an equation created from parameters on the thermistor's datasheet.

A couple things I've learned: first, the ESP32 ADC apparently is not that great. At least, that's what I'm hearing because I've not tested this myself. [Some sources](https://www.makerfabs.cc/article/cautions-in-using-esp32-adc.html#:~:text=Most%20A%2FD%20error%20takes,is%20up%20to%20100%20mV.&text=For%20both%20the%20S3%20and,that%20need%20a%20previse%20ADC.) state that the even when the voltage is safely inside the expected range an not towards one of the bounds that the error may be 100mv. 

Second, measuring ambient air temperature also isn't very straightforward. Learning that a thermometer calibrated to 0.5 C is labeled as extremely accurate is quite surprising since most *accurate* measurement tools go down to the hundredths or thousandths of a unit. Also [noted in this article](https://environmentalbiophysics.org/the-quest-for-accurate-air-temperature-part-1/) are other factors such as air flow and properties of the housing that can make ambient temperature measurement more of a case-by-case problem to solve. 

Our intended use case is indoors in a static location, but even then, the task of measuring the ambient air temperature will never be perfect. Even with a 0.1 C sensor, I'm willing to bet that in any room, there are 2 points which have an *ambient* temperature difference greater than 1C (would be something good to test..).

The second problem is pretty inherent to thermodynamics and measuring temperature in general, so I don't think we're going to deal with this outside of putting a few holes into our thermometer case. The first problem of the ADC error, however, is easily eliminated by delegating the task of converting the analog signal to a digital signal within the same chip.

After searching around, I was able to find the [TMP117 low power digital temperature sensor](https://www.ti.com/lit/ds/symlink/tmp117.pdf) which claims 0.1 C accuracy in the range of -20 C to 50 C. It is also I2C compatible, so we can read the signal directly with our ESP32 and there is no need for any more components other than a small capacitor tied to Vin and a few pull-up resistors on our I2C bus lines.

This chip works by constantly updating an internal register with the temperature reading at 1Hz (once per second). Using the I2C bus, we can read this register containing the temperature which is accurate down to something crazy like 0.07 C - accuracy we will never use. I connected the [dev board](https://www.digikey.com/en/products/detail/adafruit-industries-llc/4821/13571586) I bought to our ESP32-PICO-D4 dev board and immediately we were reading the temperature! I did notice, though, that the temperature did seem to be ~1.5 C off of other cheap thermometers I had on-hand. To combat this, though, you can specify a constant offset in one of the chip's registers, but we'll focus on calibration at a later point.

**Side Note**: I did skip the slightly embarrassing part where I accidentally soldered the breadboard pins in upside-down and since I really wanted it facing up, I put everything on a hot plate, got the breadboard pins out, but managed to drop the board and have all the SMD components fall off. I then had to solder all the components back on. So much for buying a dev board so I didn't have to do the work myself :)


### Real Life Test Bench

Now that I think (let's please hope, my wallet can't keep doing 2 digikey orders per week) I have all the components AND I've actually written test firmware for each component, I'm willing to share the current breadboard I'm using to start to piece the firmware together.  

![[wifi-thermometer-breadboard.jpg]](/wifi-thermometer/v0.1-breadboard.jpg)

Working from left to right, we have:

- a simple breadboard push button (pull-up) - this is the primary input on the device itself
- TMP117 dev board - this board contains the digital chip introduced above that reads the ambient temperature
- RGB LED - the LED will be the only output interface on the device
- ESP32-PICO-D4 - our ESP32 development module. **Note** that we are going to be using the ESP32-C3-MINI-1 module, I just haven't had the time to switch the dev board.

### Firmware Brain Block

I've been able to get example sketches working that interface with all the components you see here independently:

- I2C - this is the communication protocol used to interface the ESP32 with the TMP117
- pull-up button (with debounce)
- RGB LED
- Wifi AP
- Wifi STA
- ESP32 Deep Sleep

Even though all the components have been individually POC'd, I've got a bit of brain block on how to actually stitch them together. This is the first time I'm ever writing hardware, so the best practices and implications of choosing specific design elements still aren't completely clear to me.

It's also apparent that I'm going to need to have OTA firmware updates since I'm not planning on 

#### Proposed approach

Here's the proposed approach. I'll have 4 tasks that can run:

1. **Button Press Task** - this task handles when we press a button. There are two types of button presses we register:

	- Short button presses - these will be treated as some sort of status button. A short press will cause the RGB LED to produce a series of colors which can be diagnosed using a lookup table.
	- Long button presses - these bring the unit into pairing mode. The pairing sequence is detailed below.
	  
	The button press task was largely code copied into the project from [this git repository](https://github.com/craftmetrics/esp32-button) which includes functionality to handle debouncing the button presses.
	
	This task will be created from boot and will never be deleted. Upon a short or long button press, a task for the corresponding functionality will be created (status or pairing task).

2. **Status Task** - this task will report the current state of a firmware defined error register to the user through the RGB LED located on the board. All other tasks will be able to write to this register (which will probably be represented as a 32-bit location) and this task will convert the bits to a color code that is presented to a user.
   
   This task is self-deleting once it completes.

4. **Pairing Task** - this task allows a device to retrieve a wifi ssid and password which it can then use to connect to the network. For v0.1, this will be the only way that a non-network connected device may communicate with any other device. 
   
   As stated above, the button task drives when the pairing sequence is enabled. However, by default, if there is no network ssid or password stored on the ESP32, then pairing mode is automatically entered.
   
   This task will delete itself once completed.

4. **Configuration Task** - this task handles updates to the device configuration. This may include adjusting parameters such as:

	- interval between temperature readings
	- temperature offset
	- firmware update

	As of v0.1, the only way to enter this task is from the POST response of the **Temperature Read** task which we are repurposing to push any updates down to the device.
	
	This will be started by the main Temperature Read Loop Task if the response from the POST request is anything other than a simple OK since this response object will contain any changes that the user has made on their phone app. We'll be mindful here to try and decouple the configuration changes from the POST response.

5. **Temperature Read Loop Task** - this task initiates the I2C connection between the ESP32 and the TMP117 temperature sensor, reads the chip's temperature register, and connects to the wifi in order to send a POST request to a remote server containing the temperature telemetry.
   
   This task won't even need a loop since we are deep sleeping at the end of it. It will be interesting to see the effect of the deep sleep on any other continuous task (i.e. button).
