## Unrealistic Scope?

Initially I wanted this device to have a built-in LiPo battery and a USB-c connector that would charge that battery. After doing some research, the necessary circuitry needed to charge a LiPo safely is a bit beyond the scope of my capabilities (and realistically what I wanted to learn with this project), so while I'd still like to use a LiPo for energy density purposes, It will be most likely a AA-sized rechargeable battery. This should eliminate the need to have any LiPo charging circuitry, but does introduce another issue.

  

## 1.5v ‚ûù 3.3v

The ESP32 that I'm planning to use is powered by 3.3v. I could just use a LiPo AA-sized battery which has a 3.7v charged voltage, but those aren't very common and you still need a special charger as most rechargeable lithium consumer batteries still operate at 1.5V.

  

We'll build this for the masses, however, this does mean that we need to convert the 1.5 volts from the battery into 3.3 volts and we'll do this using a boost converter. It's not extremely common to convert 1.5v to 3.3v since most would just use another battery to get the voltage up to ~3.0v which the ESP32 can accept. But, what's the fun in that?

  

In all seriousness, there are a few drawbacks of using a boost converter at 1.5v, namely the efficiency which will start to drop off at around that voltage. I found a chip that I wanted to use, the [Texas Instruments TPS61022](https://www.ti.com/lit/ds/symlink/tps61022.pdf) which is an ultra-low-voltage input switching converter which should work fine for my purposes. Here's the efficiency graph of that chip at various voltages. I'm no expert at reading these graphs, but I believe we'll be around 90% (unless it's 90% for 1.8v input and a further 90% for a 3.3v output which would put us at ~80%):

For now, I'm ok with that efficiency. It's not ideal and when the ESP32 is in deep sleep, we're going to be even less efficient as the ESP32 is stated to draw only 20 micro amps in that state.

  

## Experimenting with the TPS61022

I'd really like to try this out and profile the chip before committing to it, but the issue is that this chip might be one of the smallest ICs I've worked with so far. It's on par with the [TMC6300 motor driver](https://www.analog.com/media/en/technical-documentation/data-sheets/TMC6300_datasheet_rev1.08.pdf) that I used on the Smart Knob and I had a bit of trouble getting that soldered. I didn't really look too closely at the specs so I sort of thought I could just solder some 30AWG wire directly to the pads, but there are two reasons why that won't work:

1. the chip is just too small
2. in the datasheet, it states that there needs to be a capacitor within a few millimeters of the `Vout` and `GND` pads so any external wiring would probably be a waste of time.


## My First PCB

How did I solve these issues? Well, by learning an entirely new skillset and making everything much more complicated!

  

I'd been wanting to design a PCB and I honestly thought the first version of the thermometer would be the first introduction I'd have to this. However, I'll bump up learning this in order to properly test one of the chips I'm considering for the final design (of the initial version, that is).

  

I'm using KiCad since it seems to be the most popular open-source PCB/schematci design software out there. The only purpose of this PCB is to test this chip, so I used a schematic pulled directly from the TPS61022 datasheet:

  
![boost-converter-schematic.png](/wifi-thermometer/boost-converter-schematic.png)
  

This resulted in a 2-layer PCB looking something like this:

  
![3d-boost-converter-pcb.png](/wifi-thermometer/3d-boost-converter-pcb.png)
  

I send that over to JLCPCB and $17 later, it's currently in production and I should have it in my hands in a couple weeks.

  

## ESP32 firmware

Along with any power considerations, I've also been playing with the ESP32 firmware. While before I was working in the Arduino IDE, I switched over to using ESP-IDF in vscode in order to have more configurability in the future when I actually implement the deep sleep and the network request to send the data.

  

I was able to get the deep sleep working (it's literally 2 lines of code), and I also had working examples of HTTP and UDP requests, so I'll work on getting the firmware finalized for an initial version.

  

## What's Next?

Once I get the PCB in, I can see if this boost converter chip is indeed going to work. If so, I can build out a first version on the breadboard once the firmware is written as well.
