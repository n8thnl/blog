## Finally Cleaning Up
##### 3-17-2024

In an attempt to reduce the de-clutter my desk (and projects in general), I'm finally starting an inventory project that hopefully will allow me to catalog the various components I have to avoid the hours of searching I always find myself doing. Or even worse, buying duplicate parts when they're sitting in some unknown location in my office.

I'll show some pictures of the current state and then explain how I'm going to approach this.

You can see that I have bins where some chips aren't even in ESD bags. Hopefully we can fix all this.  

### Requirements

*   components are keyword-searchable in some inventory system
*   component:storage location is stored in the inventory system
*   system is easily expandable (i.e. decouple the storage from the system)
*   component datasheets directly on inventory system component pages
*   system integrates with barcodes for mobile
    *  barcode is on ESD bag (or other storage container)
    *  barcode links to inventory system in order to get datasheet/storage location/other info

I'd really like to use some open source inventory solution. From what I've found, the leading solution seems to be [Inventree](https://inventree.org/) so I'm going to dive into the demo and see what it's going to take to deploy the product.

For the actual storage medium, I ended up going with both the [6L and 16L variations of these tubs](https://www.homedepot.com/p/Sterilite-6-Qt-Storage-Box-16426A60/308820126) I picked up at Home Depot. The idea is that I'll 3d print some dividers that I can label in each tub increasing storage location granularity.

I'll design and print out some dividers to show in the next update.
