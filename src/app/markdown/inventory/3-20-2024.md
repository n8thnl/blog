## Let's Make this More Complicated

### Storage Plan Update

Now that I know I can get small 6L plastic bins for $2 at Home Depot, I'm going to double down and use those for projects and part storage. The thought is that I can print the dividers on my Prusa MK3S+, but any bigger size and I wouldn't have the build plate capacity.

I went through a few iterations of dividers and ended on this one. Note that I haven't actually stored anything in the tubs yet, so it's not set in stone yet. They had an issue of not standing up straight (should only be an issue when I don't have enough parts in the buckets), but it was enough to warrant printing of another small part to clamp onto the bottom. This design is preferred since I _hate_ printing with supports.

### Inventree

The plan was to explore Inventree, an open-source inventory management system. I installed it on an EC2 instance and was able to get away with a t2.small configuration without it freezing, but, the TLS configuration didn't seem very straightforward, so I'm just going to install it on an ubuntu laptop I have laying around and just manage the inventory on that. It didn't really make sense to boot up the small server I have in my house or keep the EC2 instance up and running since we're looking at roughly $10-15 per month in electricity (if going with the home server) or t2.small hours. The good thing is that it looks like the software will work out and the installation truly a single click if you don't have to customize anything.
