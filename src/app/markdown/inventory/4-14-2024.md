## Cardboard is King
##### 4-14-2024

On the topic of storage medium, previously I had been printing the storage bin dividers, but a couple problems that came out of that:

1. Each divider took roughly 45 minutes to print
2. The dividers only had a thin web for the structure, meaning smaller objects could possible pass through the dividers
3. Given the print orientation, the dividers would've required a completely separate foot design in order to have the divider supported from the front AND the back

  

Because of this, I decided to try just using the printed divider as a stencil and cut the shapes out of cardboard. Then, I could just print feet which slid onto the bottom of the cardboard panel. This also gave me the advantage of being able to write more than just a single number on the panels.

In order to determine how many bins and what should go into each, I just used ChatGPT to tell me what were the common categories of XYZ, then I was able to narrow down the options to components that I anticipate using. The best part is that I can always change this, too.

  

### Inventree

On the Inventree side, I ended up setting up my HPE microserver (roast me, I know) with ubuntu server and inventree installed. I'm extremely impressed with the software and how intuitive it is to infer the data model and start creating an inventory.

  

I was able to create categories for each part, but also separately create storage locations which correspond to the bins I have and each slot within each bin. When I am cataloguing a new part, I:

1. Select the correct category
2. Name the part
3. Set the location for the part
4. Put in the supplier and the supplier's part number
5. Populate a link to the supplier's site
6. Upload a picture of the part
7. Input the number of stock for the item
8. Attach a link to the datasheet
9. Print out a QR code and stick it on the part's bag

  

**Note:** originally I had been using Inventree on a laptop, which let me use the laptop integrated camera to read the QR codes. I'm not sure why it's not letting me do that now when using my laptop as a client to the server which is running Inventree since the client just converts the QR code into a URL/part number. I'll look into this, but in the meantime, I was able to download a chrome extension which allowed me to read the QR code, copy the data in the QR code (i.e. part number), and paste that into the inventree search. Not ideal at all.

  

I have a pretty big backlog of inventory, but I'm making good slow progress. I'm trying to hold off on starting any new projects until I can get this done since pulling parts without the system fully in place will just mess everything up.
