# An Introduction

### Who are you?

Hey, whoa, easy there. In a few words, I'm just like a lot of others. I like to write software and do neat projects in my free time. As you'll see in the articles that follow, my breadth of interests stretches far. I'm always down to pick up a new skill, learn a new _thing._ Honestly, that's what I prefer.

  

### So, why are you writing this stuff?

I've found the documentation and packaging of these projects to be severely lacking. It's hard to convey to people exactly the way you like to think or the breadth of your skills when you only have one or two pages of A4 paper.

  

Factoring in my wish to write more things more often, that's why I'm here. I don't think I'm a bad writer - whenever I'm forced to communicate something informational, it tends to turn out fairly well. But I'd like to get better.

  

### What to expect?

I would expect a little bit of everything. While I'm expecting the majority of things posted here to be immediately tech-adjacent, who knows if I'll sneak in a bit of another hobby. We'll see. I imagine this to be almost like a periodic snapshot of what I'm working on, in slightly more formal wrapping paper.

  

### What should you do?

If you like anything you see here, give it a like or put a comment on one of the articles (if this feature exists - at the time of writing this, I've not even touched the UI for this). If any of the code helped you out, or if you like the way I did something, give the repository a star. And as always, ask any questions or offer any suggestions or improvements. And if you've made it this far, I'd just like to thank you for your time.
